# ðŸŒ¿ Thyme

_**Thyme** is a stopwatch in your taskbar with history._

## Installation

**Windows:** Download the latest installer from the [release page](https://github.com/JupiterPi/thyme/releases/latest). 

**Other platforms:** As of now, you'll have to build from source: `git clone https://github.com/JupiterPi/thyme && cd themy && npm i && npm run build`

## Features

- The **tray icon** is an activity indicator that lights up green/gray to indicate that the stopwatch is/isn't running. Click it to toggle the stopwatch. Double-click to show/hide the UI window(s).
- Every time you stop the stopwatch, an **entry is saved to the history** including the start and end time. 
- The small **dashboard** shows you whether a stopwatch is running, as well as the start time and duration. 
- The **history** page displays all entries in chronological order and grouped by day. Click on one to edit the start and end times. 

Thyme is in development, and more features are on the way. 

Thank you for using Thyme ðŸŒ¿
